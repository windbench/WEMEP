GABLS3
======================================

Background
~~~~~~~~~~
The GEWEX Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study (GABLS) series of benchmarks have been developed to improve the representation of the atmospheric boundary layer in regional and large-scale atmospheric models. The model intercomparison studies have been organized for single-column models (SCM) and large-eddy simulation models (LES). The cases are based on observations over flat terrain in the Artic, Kansas (USA), Cabauw (The Netherlands) and Dome C (Antarctica).

GABLS1 simulated a quasi-steady stable boundary layer resulting from 9 hours of uniform surface cooling [1][2][3]:ref:`references`. GABLS2 simulated a diurnal cycle, still with idealized forcing, by simplifying measurements from the CASES-99 experiment in Kansas [4][5]. GABLS3 simulated a real diurnal case with a strong nocturnal low-level jet (LLJ) at the Cabauw met tower in the Netherlands [6][7][8][9][10]. In GABLS4, the aim is to study the interaction of a boundary layer with strong stability in relatively simple surface coupling characteristics.

The challenges of stable boundary layers and diurnal cycles are reviewed by Hotlslag et al. [11], notably: the relation between enhanced mixing in operational weather models performance, investigate the role of land-surface heterogeneity in the coupling with the atmosphere, develop LES models with interactive land-surface schemes, create a climatology of boundary-layer parameters (stability classes, boundary-layer depth, and surface fluxes) and develop parameterizations for the very stable boundary layer when turbulence is not the dominant driver. These challenges are ultimately shared by wind energy applications that are embeded in atmospheric models.

The GABLS benchmarks are revisited in Windbench as baseline for the design of microscale wind farm flow models that progressively incorporate more complex atmospheric physics. Wind energy specific quantities of interest are used in order to focus the model evaluation on the application of interest.

The GABLS activities are coordinated within under the GEWEX Modelling and Prediction Panel (GMPP). The cases have been throughly documented in the literature and in the following websites:
GABLS1: SCM, LES
GABLS2
GABLS3: SCM, LES
GABLS4
In the context of developing a downscaling methodology to link mesoscale wind climate processes and microscale wind farm flow models, the GABLS3 case is particularly relevant. GABLS 1 and 2 can be considered as precursor cases dealing with turbulence modelling of the atmospheric boundary layer under idealized forcing conditions. These cases are suitable for the design of RANS-based SCMs by comparison with LES simulations, that have shown high consistency [3][5]. GABLS3 incorporates realistic forcing by using mesoscale
