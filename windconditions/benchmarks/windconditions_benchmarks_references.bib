A brief overview of the experiments and findings used to formulate the universal functions in the presently used form is given. Finally, the current status of the theory is described, covering topics such as the accuracy of the universal functions and the turbulent Prandtl number.},

	abstract = {In computational models of wind engineering problems within the atmospheric surface layer the approach flow should normally be modelled as a homogeneous flow. Velocity and turbulence profiles associated with the k-ϵ turbulence model are proposed which produce homogeneous conditions. These equations are discussed in the light of full-scale measurements at Silsoe using sonic anemometers. It is suggested that the model constants k = 0.42, Cμ = 0.013 and σϵ = 3.22 more closely match the data obtained. It is also shown that the cospectrum for the Reynolds stress exhibits a characteristics frequency no ≈ u∗/z which is consistent with the suggested profile equations.},

	abstract = {Accurate Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flow are essential for a wide variety of atmospheric studies including pollutant dispersion and deposition. The accuracy of such simulations can be seriously compromised when wall-function roughness modifications based on experimental data for sand-grain roughened pipes and channels are applied at the bottom of the computational domain. This type of roughness modification is currently present in many CFD codes including Fluent 6.2 and Ansys CFX 10.0, previously called CFX-5. The problems typically manifest themselves as unintended streamwise gradients in the vertical mean wind speed and turbulence profiles as they travel through the computational domain. These gradients can be held responsible—at least partly—for the discrepancies that are sometimes found between seemingly identical CFD simulations performed with different CFD codes and between CFD simulations and measurements. This paper discusses the problem by focusing on the simulation of a neutrally stratified, fully developed, horizontally homogeneous ABL over uniformly rough, flat terrain. The problem and its negative consequences are discussed and suggestions to improve the CFD simulations are made.},

The associated paper is available at: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/524/1/012105 Abstract The IEA Task 31 Wakebench is setting up a framework for the evaluation of wind farm flow models operating at microscale level. The framework consists on a model evaluation protocol integrated on a web-based portal for model benchmarking (www.windbench.net). This paper provides an overview of the building-block validation approach applied to flow-over-terrain models, including best practices for the benchmarking and data processing procedures for the analysis and qualification of validation datasets from wind resource assessment campaigns. A hierarchy of test cases has been proposed for flow-over-terrain model evaluation, from Monin-Obukhov similarity theory for verification of surface-layer properties, to the Leipzig profile for the near-neutral atmospheric boundary layer, to flow over isolated hills (Askervein and Bolund) to flow over mountaneous complex terrain (Alaiz). A summary of results from the first benchmarks are used to illustrate the model evaluation protocol applied to flow-over-terrain modeling in neutral conditions.},
